# Brain_Tumor_MRI

This project applies a ResNet-based deep learning model to classify MRI brain images into Tumor and No Tumor categories. We fine-tuned a ResNet architecture (such as ResNet-50) using transfer learning techniques and MRI scan datasets. The model is trained with data augmentation and evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Dataset includes MRI images organized into tumor and non-tumor folders. After training, the model can predict tumor presence in new MRI scans with high confidence. Results show accuracy exceeding 96%.
